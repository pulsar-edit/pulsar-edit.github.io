## About us

### The team

The team behind Pulsar is a community that came about naturally after the
announcement of [Atom's Sunset](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)
and decided that they needed to do something about it to keep their favorite
editor alive.

This is a true community-led project to modernize, update and improve the
original Atom project into a contemporary, hackable and fully open editor.

Pulsar is all of us, feel free to contribute, discuss, answer questions and
suggest ideas in any of our [community areas](./community.md).

### The goals <!--See: https://github.com/orgs/pulsar-edit/discussions/50-->

- Community developed, led and focused
  - Pulsar is being made by a community who came together from the stellar
    remnants of Atom. A community that wants to build upon the huge legacy that
    was left and make a uniquely hackable editor.
- To continue and build upon the legacy of the Atom text editor which has been [sunset](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).
  - This means not only supporting the editor itself but also the package
    repository with its thousands of community contributions.
- Update core technologies to bring the editor up to date.
  - Core technologies such as Node.js, Electron etc., keeping them up to date so
    new features and libraries can be used and added without hacky workarounds.
- Emphasize the elements that make the editor great to really make Pulsar stand
  out from the crowd, not only for ex-Atom users but for everyone.
