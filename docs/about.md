## The team

The team behind Pulsar is a community that came about organically after the announcement of [Atom’s sunset](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). We decided that we needed to do something to keep our favorite editor alive.

Pulsar is a community-led project to modernize, update, and improve the original Atom project into a contemporary, hackable and fully open editor.

Pulsar is all of us! Feel free to contribute, discuss, answer questions and suggest ideas in any of our [community areas](/community).

## The goals <!--See: https://github.com/orgs/pulsar-edit/discussions/50-->

### Remain community-developed, -led, and -focused

The Pulsar community has the collective goal of building upon Atom’s sizable legacy. Decisions are made by those who participate and contribute; everyone helps decide how Pulsar evolves, not just a select few.

### Keep the things that make it unique

Atom’s design choices set it apart among editors. It is important to maintain those design choices as much as possible — especially since it helps us maintain compatibility with the thousands of community-contributed packages that already exist.

### Bring the editor’s core technologies up to date

Both Electron and Pulsar’s core modules need periodic updating to take advantage of new features in Node and Chromium.
