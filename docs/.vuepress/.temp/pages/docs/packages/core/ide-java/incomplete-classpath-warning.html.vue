<p>In order to properly analyze Java files a project definition must be found that indicates the packages, paths to search for classes etc.</p>
<p>You should open the folder that contains the pom.xml or build.gradle file if you want full diagnostics, errors, auto-completion etc.</p>
<p>If you don't need the full analysis you can ignore this warning and work with a subset of the available features.</p>
