<p>This aims to be a collection of information about the packages published for the Pulsar Editor. Currently, anything in <a href="#core-packages">Core Packages</a> is an archive of every Wiki that was published from the upstream Atom Organization.</p>
<p>This means some of this information may be old, or no longer relevant. If it is, it has been marked as so at the top of the file under a warning. None-the-less the information can still be helpful, and may prove to be valuable. Which is why it has been archived here.</p>
<p>As well, we have a record of <a href="#community-packages">community packages</a> as well. This is meant to be a record of these. This section should be updated as we get more community contributions of these. The process for adding this will be added at a later date.</p>
