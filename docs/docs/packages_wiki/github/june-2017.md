:::

## Looking Back 

* Beta launch went very well
* Relatively few problems
* Performance work @smashwilson and @kuychaco did is ✨
* GPG/credential helper work that @smashwilson shipped was solid
* Feeling good about shipping to stable 

## This Month 

* Ensure room to triage and fix issues that may arise after shipping to stable 
* File change notification service @smashwilson 
* GitHub integration @BinaryMuse @kuychaco 
  * Create new PR 
  * Fill out existing functionality (timeline item types, new fields, etc.)
  * Add mechanism for manual/auto refreshing 
  * Continue to investigate possibility of real-time updates
* Git integration @kuychaco
  * Add "last commit(s)" view under commit box
  * Investigate removing amend checkbox in favor of more robust HEAD management

## Other Topics Discussed 

* Web Workers 
  * Wait to see if issues arise with current implementation 
* Better remote/branch management 
  * Existing UI mocks are relatively old and pre-docks 
  * Want to ensure what we ship is close to what we'll want long term to ensure UI/UX stability over time 
  * Resume conversation around design and pick this up in coming months 
* `core:undo` support 
  * Undo support is a misnomer in a system where there's not a linear set of edits 
  * Want to design a system where any action is recoverable (different from undoable)
  * Really talking about UI Git porcelain at this point 
  * Start deeper conversations now, talk about more at mini-summit 
* Git log / graph 
  * We could do something simple now very quickly but would it be up to the standards we want?
  * Decided to work on "last commit(s)" view for June, talk about this more at mini-summit 
* Stash support 
  * Start talking about UI/UX
* Additional GitHub PR work 
  * "Checking out" a PR from the GH pane is a great first step toward implementing a full code review flow
