# Atom Documentation Archive

This is an archive of the old Atom documentation as it appeared on their
[Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io). Anything here is just a historical
reference of our past, when Atom existed as a GitHub supported project.

This includes their original layout and formatting of how things were expected
to appear. Anything listed here, may work, and it may not. This is taking into
consideration their sunset and our picking up of their torch.
