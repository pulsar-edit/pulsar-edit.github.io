## Using Atom

Now that we've covered the very basics of Atom, we are ready to see how to really start getting the most out of using it. In this chapter we'll look at how to find and install new packages in order to add new functionality, how to find and install new themes, how to work with and manipulate text in a more advanced way, how to customize the editor in any way you wish, how to work with Git for version control and more.

At the end of this chapter, you should have a customized environment that you're comfortable in and you should be able to change, create and move through your text like a master.
