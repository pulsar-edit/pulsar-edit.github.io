## Upgrading to 1.0 APIs

::: note

**Note:** Atom has been at v1.x for over a year, so this appendix is mostly obsolete at this point. We're retaining it for historic and reference purposes.

:::

Atom is at 1.0! Much of the effort leading up to the 1.0 has been cleaning up APIs in an attempt to future proof, and make a more pleasant experience developing packages. If you have developed packages or syntaxes for Atom before the 1.0 API, you can find some tips on upgrading your work in this appendix.
