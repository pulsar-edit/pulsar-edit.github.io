Now it's time to come to the "Hackable" part of the Hyper-Hackable Editor. As
we've seen throughout the second section, a huge part of Pulsar is made up of
bundled packages. If you wish to add some functionality to Pulsar, you have
access to the same APIs and tools that the core features of Pulsar has. From the
[tree-view](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/tree-view) to the [command-palette](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/command-palette)
to [find-and-replace](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/find-and-replace)
functionality, even the most core features of Pulsar are implemented as packages.

In this section, we're going to learn how to extend the functionality of Pulsar
through writing packages. This will be everything from new user interfaces to
new language grammars to new themes. We'll learn this by writing a series of
increasingly complex packages together, introducing you to new APIs and tools
and techniques as we need them.

First though we will look at how to build the editor itself from source.

If you're looking for an example or specific section using a specific API or
feature, you can check below for an index to this section and skip right to it.
