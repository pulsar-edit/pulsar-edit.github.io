## Creating a Theme

Pulsar's interface is rendered using HTML, and it's styled via [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
which is a superset of CSS. Don't worry if you haven't heard of Less before;
it's just like CSS, but with a few handy extensions.

Pulsar supports two types of themes: _UI_ and _Syntax_. UI themes style elements
such as the tree view, the tabs, drop-down lists, and the status bar. Syntax
themes style the code, gutter and other elements inside the editor view.

Themes can be installed and changed from the Settings View which you can open by
selecting the
**_LNX_**: _Edit > Preferences_ -
**_MAC_**: _Pulsar > Preferences_ -
**_WIN_**: _File > Preferences_
menu, and clicking the "Install" or "Themes" tab on the left hand navigation.

### Getting Started

Themes are pretty straightforward but it's still helpful to be familiar with a
few things before starting:

- Less is a superset of CSS, but it has some really handy features like
  variables. If you aren't familiar with its syntax, take a few minutes to
  [familiarize yourself](https://speakerdeck.com/danmatthews/less-css).
- You may also want to review the concept of a `package.json` (as covered in
  [Pulsar `package.json`](#package-json)). This file is used to help distribute
  your theme to Pulsar users.
- Your theme's `package.json` must contain a `theme` key with a value of `ui` or
  `syntax` for Pulsar to recognize and load it as a theme.
- You can find existing themes to install or fork in
  [Pulsar Package Repository](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages). <!--TODO: Update to a themes URL if we get one on the front end site-->

### Creating a Syntax Theme

Let's create your first theme.

To get started, press
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd>
and start typing `Generate Syntax Theme` to generate a new theme package. Select
`Generate Syntax Theme`, and you'll be asked for the path where your theme will
be created. Let's call ours `motif-syntax`.

::: tip Tip

Syntax themes should end with _-syntax_ and UI themes should end with _-ui_.

:::

Pulsar will display a new window, showing the motif-syntax theme, with a default
set of folders and files created for us. If you open the Settings View with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+,</kbd>
and click the "Themes" tab on the left, you'll see the "Motif" theme listed in
the "Syntax Theme" drop-down. Select it from the menu to activate it, now when
you open an editor you should see your new motif-syntax theme in action.

Open up `styles/colors.less` to change the various color variables which have
already been defined. For example, turn `@red` into `#f4c2c1`.

Then open `styles/base.less` and modify the various selectors that have already
been defined. These selectors style different parts of code in the editor such
as comments, strings and the line numbers in the gutter.

As an example, let's make the `.gutter` `background-color` into `@red`.

Reload Pulsar by pressing
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+R</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+L</kbd>
to see the changes you made reflected in your Pulsar window. Pretty neat!

::: tip Tip

You can avoid reloading to see changes you make by opening an Pulsar window in
Dev Mode. To open a Dev Mode Pulsar window run `pulsar --dev .` in the terminal,
or use the _View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode_ menu. When you edit your theme,
changes will instantly be reflected!

:::

::: note Note

It's advised to _not_ specify a `font-family` in your syntax theme because it
will override the Font Family field in Pulsar's settings. If you still like to
recommend a font that goes well with your theme, we suggest you do so in your
README.

### Creating a UI Theme

To create a UI theme, do the following:

1. Fork the [ui-theme-template](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ui-theme-template)
2. Clone the forked repository to the local filesystem
3. Open a terminal in the forked theme's directory
4. Open your new theme in a Dev Mode Pulsar window run `pulsar --dev .` in the
   terminal or use the _View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode_ menu
5. Change the name of the theme in the theme's `package.json` file
6. Name your theme end with a `-ui`, for example `super-white-ui`
7. Run `pulsar -p link --dev` to symlink your repository to
   **_LNX/MAC_**: `~/.pulsar/dev/packages` -
   **_WIN_**: `%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar`
8. Reload Pulsar using
   **_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+R</kbd> -
   **_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+L</kbd>
9. Enable the theme via the "UI Theme" drop-down in the "Themes" tab of the
   Settings View
10. Make changes! Since you opened the theme in a Dev Mode window, changes will
    be instantly reflected in the editor without having to reload.

::: tip Tip

Because we used `pulsar -p link --dev` in the above instructions, if you break
anything you can always close Pulsar and launch Pulsar normally to force Pulsar
to the default theme. This allows you to continue working on your theme even if
something goes catastrophically wrong.

:::

### Theme Variables

UI themes **must** provide a `ui-variables.less` and Syntax themes a
`syntax-variables.less` file. It contains predefined variables that packages use
to make sure the look and feel matches.

Here the variables with the default values:

- [ui-variables.less](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/blob/master/static/variables/ui-variables.less)
- [syntax-variables.less](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/blob/master/static/variables/syntax-variables.less)

These default values will be used as a fallback in case a theme doesn't define
its own variables.

#### Use in Packages

In any of your package's `.less` files, you can access the theme variables by
importing the `ui-variables` or `syntax-variables` file from Pulsar.

Your package should generally only specify structural styling, and these should
come from [the style guide](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/styleguide). Your
package shouldn't specify colors, padding sizes, or anything in absolute pixels.
You should instead use the theme variables. If you follow this guideline, your
package will look good out of the box with any theme!

Here's an example `.less` file that a package can define using theme variables:

```css
@import "ui-variables";

.my-selector {
  background-color: @base-background-color;
  padding: @component-padding;
}
```

```css
@import "syntax-variables";

.my-selector {
  background-color: @syntax-background-color;
}
```

### Development workflow

There are a few tools to help make theme development faster and easier.

#### Live Reload

Reloading by pressing
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+R</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+L</kbd>
after you make changes to your theme is less than ideal. Pulsar supports
[live updating](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/master/packages/dev-live-reload)
of styles on Pulsar windows in Dev Mode.

To launch a Dev Mode window:

- Open your theme directory in a dev window by selecting the
  _View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode_ menu item
- Or launch Pulsar from the terminal with `pulsar --dev`

If you'd like to reload all the styles at any time, you can use the shortcut
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+R</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+L</kbd>,

#### Developer Tools

Pulsar is based on the Chromium browser and supports its Developer Tools. You
can open them by selecting the _View > Developer > Toggle Developer Tools_ menu,
or by using the
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+I</kbd>

The dev tools allow you to inspect elements and take a look at their CSS
properties.

![Developer Tools](@images/atom/dev-tools.png)

Check out Google's [extensive tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/dom-and-styles)
for a short introduction.

#### Pulsar Styleguide

If you are creating an UI theme, you'll want a way to see how your theme changes
affect all the components in the system. The [Styleguide](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/styleguide)
is a page that renders every component Pulsar supports.

To open the Styleguide, open the command palette with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd>
and search for `styleguide`, or use the shortcut
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+G</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+G</kbd>.

![Style Guide](@images/atom/styleguide.png)

#### Side by side

Sometimes when creating a theme (or package) things can go wrong and the editor
becomes unusable. E.g. if the text and background have the same color or
something gets pushed out of sight. To avoid having to open Pulsar in "normal"
mode to fix the issue, it's advised to open **two** Pulsar windows. One for
making changes and one in Dev Mode to see the changes getting applied.

![Side by side screenshot](@images/atom/theme-side-by-side.png)

> Make changes on the **left**, see the changes getting applied in "Dev Mode"
> on the **right**.

Now if you mess up something, only the window in "Dev Mode" will be affected and
you can easily correct the mistake in your "normal" window.

### Publish your theme

Once you're happy with your theme and would like to share it with other Pulsar
users, it's time to publish it. :tada:

Follow the steps on the [Publishing](#publishing/) page. The example used is for
the Word Count package, but publishing a theme works exactly the same.
