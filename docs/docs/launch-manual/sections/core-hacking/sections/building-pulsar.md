## Building Pulsar

If you want to investigate a bug, implement a new feature in Pulsar's core or
just want to tinker then you will need to build and run Pulsar from source.

The Pulsar application code can be found in the
[pulsar-edit/pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar) repository.

### Requirements and dependencies

To build Pulsar you will need to meet some basic requirements:

- Node.js (version specified in [pulsar/.nvmrc](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/blob/master/.nvmrc),
  recommended installation is via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- yarn (enable with `corepack enable`)
- Git
- Python
- C++ toolchain
- [Libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) development headers

For OS or distribution specific instructions see below:

::: tabs#core-hacking

@tab Linux

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```sh
# Install development packages
apt install build-essential libxkbfile-dev libsecret-1-dev libx11-dev
```

#### Fedora/RHEL

```sh
# Install development packages
dnf --assumeyes install make gcc gcc-c++ glibc-devel git-core libsecret-devel rpmdevtools libX11-devel libxkbfile-devel nss atk gdk-pixbuf2 gtk3 mesa-dri-drivers
```

#### Arch

```sh
# Install the development packges
pacman -S base-devel libxkbfile libsecret libx11 libxcrypt-compat
```

#### OpenSUSE

```sh
# Install development packages
zypper in -t pattern devel_basis
zypper in libX11-devel libxkbfile-devel libsecret-devel
```

@tab macOS

```sh
TODO
```

@tab Windows

Firstly install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) from Microsoft.

### Building and running the application

To build the application so you can start hacking on the core you will need to
download the source code to your local machine and `cd` to the pulsar directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar.git && cd pulsar
```

Install Node.js (using `nvm` - see above) and enable corepack (for `yarn`).
This will install the version of Node.js specified in [pulsar/.nvmrc](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/blob/master/.nvmrc):

```sh
nvm install
corepack enable
```

If Node.js is already installed, run the following to make sure the correct
version of Node.js is being used (see [requirements](#requirements-and-dependencies)):

```sh
nvm use
node -v
```

Run the following to initialize and update the submodules:

```sh
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

Now install and build Pulsar & ppm:

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
yarn build:apm
```

Start Pulsar!

```sh
yarn start
```

These instructions will also build `ppm` (Pulsar Package Manager) but it will
require some [additional configuration](#using-ppm-pulsar-package-manager) for
use.

### Building binaries

The following will allow you to build Pulsar as a stand alone binary or
installer. After running you will find your built application in
`pulsar/binaries`.

The build script will automatically build for your system's CPU architecture,
for example building on an `x86_64` CPU will produce binaries for `x86_64`,
building on `arm64` will only produce binaries for `arm64`.

It is not possible to "cross-build" for different OSs. For Linux binaries you
must build from a Linux machine, macOS binaries must be built from macOS etc.
Your OS is detected automatically and the script will build the correct binaries
for it.

::: tabs#core-hacking

@tab Linux

By default running `yarn dist` will attempt to create `appimage` (for most Linux
distributions), `deb` (for Debian or Ubuntu based distributions) and
`rpm` (for Red Hat or Fedora based distributions) binaries but you can select
the actual target you want to build by appending the above targets to the
command. e.g.:

- `yarn dist appimage`
- `yarn dist deb`
- `yarn dist rpm`
- `yarn dist targz`

@tab macOS

`yarn dist` will create a `dmg` installer, there are currently no additional
targets for macOS.

As noted above this builds for your current CPU architecture. i.e. on an Intel
Mac this will create Intel binaries, on Apple silicon (M1, M2 etc.) this will
create Apple silicon binaries.

@tab Windows

By default running `yarn dist` will attempt to create an `NSIS` installer as
well as a `Portable` executable which does not require installation.
If you only wish to build one then you can specify it by appending the above
targets to the command e.g.:

- `yarn dist nsis`
- `yarn dist portable`
