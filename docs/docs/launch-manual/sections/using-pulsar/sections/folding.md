If you want to see an overview of the structure of the code file you're working
on, folding can be a helpful tool. Folding hides blocks of code such as
functions or looping blocks in order to simplify what is on your screen.

To fold everything, use <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+Shift+[</kbd> and to unfold everything use
<kbd>Alt+Ctrl+Shift+]</kbd>. You can also fold at a specific indentation level
with <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl+0-9</kbd> where the number is the indentation
depth.

Finally, you can fold arbitrary sections of your code or text by making a
selection and then typing <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+F</kbd> or choosing "Fold Selection" in
the Command Palette.
