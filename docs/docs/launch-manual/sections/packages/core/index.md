# Core Pulsar Packages Documentation

This aims to be a collection of information about the first-party packages published for Pulsar.

Secondly, and currently, it is an archive of every Wiki that was published from the upstream Atom Organization.

This means some of this information may be old, or no longer relevant. If it is, it has been marked as so at the top of the file under a warning.

None-the-less the information can still be helpful, and may prove to be valuable. Which is why it has been archived here.

## Archived Wikis

- [Atom-LanguageClient](/docs/packages_wiki/atom-languageclient/index.md)
- [Autocomplete-Plus](/docs/packages_wiki/autocomplete-plus/index.md)
