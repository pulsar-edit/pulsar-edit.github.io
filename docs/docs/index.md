## Welcome to Pulsar

Here you will find everything you need to know about Pulsar, from how to
install it all the way to hacking away at its core to make it your own.

The documentation has been broken down into various sections which you can find
below.

### [<i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> Launch Manual](/docs/launch-manual/)

The Launch Manual contains everything you need to know about Pulsar. It covers
topics all the way from the initial installation through to developing and
publishing your own packages.

### [<i class="fa-solid fa-box-open"></i> Packages](/docs/packages/)

This section is dedicated to info and documentation around Pulsar's numerous
packages which make up both the core editor and community ecosystem.

### [<i class="fa-solid fa-wrench"></i> Resources](/docs/resources)

There are a number of miscellaneous resources here that do not necessarily
fit into other topics. This is where you will find information about things
like the tools used by the team and contributors, a glossary to translate
any confusing jargon and details of the various APIs that make up Pulsar.

### [<i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive"></i> Atom Archive](/docs/atom-archive/)

This is an archive of the old Atom documentation as it appeared on their
[Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io/).

Anything here is just a historical reference of our past, when Atom existed as a
GitHub supported project.

This includes their original layout and formatting of how things were expected
to appear. Anything listed here, may work, and it may not. This is taking into
consideration their sunset and our picking up of their torch.
