::: info "Rolling" and "Regular" Releases

We have ["Rolling"](#rolling-release) and ["Regular"](#regular-releases) releases to choose from. These differ only in the frequency of updates they receive.

Note: There are no automatic updates at this time, regardless of which type of download you choose.

:::

## Rolling Release

These releases are built on each push to our `master` branch and automatically
built by [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/pulsar-edit/pulsar). These
releases come with the latest fixes, updates and improvements so this is a great
choice if you want to get the latest features as soon as possible.

While we do our best to review and test each PR thoroughly before merging there
is a chance that something falls through the cracks in which case be prepared to
upgrade or switch to our [Regular Releases](#regular-releases) until it is
fixed.

See below for links to the latest binaries for each OS. If you want to download
manually or pick a binary from another branch or PR, then follow the [manual instructions](#manual-download).

## Regular Releases

These releases are put out regularly according to milestones defined by the
Pulsar team (currently roughly monthly).

Compared to our [Rolling Release](#rolling-release) these offer a more
understood state by the team in terms of support. However these will sometimes
feature issues that have already been resolved in our Rolling Release so if a
particular fix or feature is important to you it may be worth swapping to one of
those instead.

Current version is [v1.104.0](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/tag/v1.104.0).

## Manual download

Binaries are built from a number of different branches and PRs but you should
stick to the **master** branch releases for the most stable ones unless you know
exactly what you are looking for.

To download a binary from Cirrus CI please follow the below steps:

- Go to the master branch [Pulsar Cirrus CI page](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/pulsar-edit/pulsar/master).
- Select the latest successful build (check for a **_finished_** green check
  mark âœ… on the right side of the page - make sure you do not select a
  **_failed_** one).
- Select your system from the list of options:
  - **linux** - x86 Linux systems
  - **arm-linux** - ARM based Linux systems (Raspberry Pi etc.)
  - **silicon_mac** - M1 and M2 chip Apple Macs
  - **intel_mac** - Intel chip Apple Macs
  - **windows** - Microsoft Windows systems
- Select **binary** > **binaries** from the **Artifacts** pane
- Download the binary you require for your system:

::: tabs#downloads

@tab Linux

Four binaries are currently available:

- `Appimage` for a universal Linux binary (should work on most systems)
- `rpm` for Red Hat based OSs (Fedora, RHEL etc.)
- `deb` for Debian or Ubuntu based OSs
- `tar.gz` generic binary for most Linux systems

@tab macOS

Two binaries are provided:

- `dmg` standard installer image
- `zip` containing the application binary for manual installation.

@tab Windows

Two binaries are currently available:

- `Pulsar Setup...exe` is the installer based executable that will install Pulsar
  on your system
- `Pulsar...exe` is the "portable" version which can run without needing to be
  installed on the system (for example from a flash drive).
