## Pulsar v1.129.0: An _August_ Occasion

Howdy folks,

Another fine Pulsar release, Pulsar 1.129.0, is available for your use and enjoyment. See changelog below for details.

A big shout-out to @Drsheppard01 for their first contribution in the form of PR [#1241](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1241), and to @jmanuel1 for the issue report [#1302](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/issues/1302) that led to a quick fix from @savetheclocktower in PR [#1303](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1303). And to several members of the community who have given feedback on GitHub, Discord, etc.

As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!
\- The Pulsar Team

## 1.129.0

- Some minor Tree-sitter fixes, including fixing a bug in SCSS highlighting and ensuring proper highlighting support for abstract methods in TypeScript.
- When viewing a file that exists on disk outside of your project root, you may now use **Tree View: Rename** to “import” it into your project folder by giving it a relative path.
- Updated various dependencies for security reasons.
- Updated AppImages to type 2 runtime -- `libfuse` is no-longer required to be installed on the end-user's system to use Pulsar's AppImages!
