# What is new in 1.105.0?

This newest release of Pulsar contains many changes, from new features, to security patches, to testing improvements, this release has it all, and we hope it shows!

A big milestone for this release, is since our initial fork from Atom, we have now created fully green (passing) tests! This hopefully means we can iterate new changes, both fixes and new features, faster than ever before!

Also on this release we ensured to put a focus on solving the issues reported by our wonderful community such as resolving an issue that would prevent installation of Pulsar on RPM systems, fixing localization issues in `settings-view` when browsing packages, or addressing memory leak issues within `second-mate`.

Even better this release also comes with some brand new features and improvements to existing ones! Such as the addition of new community package activation hooks, adding a new `bookmarks` service to the ServiceHub, and updating the internal `typescript` used to support advancements within that language for community packages to take advantage of.

But this summary can't possibly include everything, make sure to take a look through the changelog below to see everything this release has to offer!

As always, we want to say a huge thanks to everyone that contributes to Pulsar, from the much appreciated donations, the critical issue reports, or amazing pull requests we receive. We appreciate every single one of you, and couldn't do any of this without you!

Till next time, happy coding, and see you among the stars!
