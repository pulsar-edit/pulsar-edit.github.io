A short survey asking for community feedback on a couple of aspects of the project

<!-- more -->

Due to the success of the first survey we have decided to use this format again to seek community opinion on a couple of elements of the project.

In particular we are looking for feedback on some Pulsar UI changes, our documentation and publishing community packages.

There is no need to sign into any account to respond to this survey and no personal data is being collected (emails, names etc.).

[You can find the Survey (Google Forms) here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnEEAQHUJbRVcH2NlNvLxmK0ZUcb5xuOCt1pYOGytvne0kJw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
