# Second (Beta) Tagged Release of Pulsar -- Many improvements available!

With the release of Pulsar Beta 1.101.0 we have quite a number of improvements and fixes to various issues that have been identified and logged by our wonderful community.

Have a read of the changelog for the full details but some highlights include fixes to the Pulsar logo on Windows and Linux, a bunch of macOS changes to bring back some of the original functionality with opening files, and the resolution of an annoying issue on Linux that could stop the app from launching at all!

Thank you so much to everyone who has been involved in this release, every comment to our discussions board or Discord server, every issue logged on GitHub and every pull request created have all contributed to getting us where we are today.

And a special thank you for all of the donations we have received, we have some plans to use these wisely for the good of the project so look forward to the next big release!

So please, if you have any comments then please join us on our Discord or discussions page, if you find any bugs or regressions then let us know via a GitHub issue (and if you can fix it (or anything else) then feel free to open a pull request).

And as always, happy coding, see you among the stars!
