# What is new in 1.103.0?

With this release, we have a number of quality-of-life updates to make things just that little bit easier.

One big change is a new settings search page! No longer will you have to trawl through the settings and packages to find that one pesky bit of config, now everything is just a few keystrokes away! This feature is still experimental and will have more updates and tweaks coming, but please feel free to [provide feedback](https://github.com/orgs/pulsar-edit/discussions/150) so we can continue to improve it.

We have some updates to our snippets, autocomplete-css, and github packages, which you can read about in the change log, that bring about a whole host of improvements from updated UI to new functionality to really improve your coding experience!

Of course, no update would be complete without a massive thank you to our wonderful community, especially our contributors and donors who are making all this possible.

And as ever, happy coding. See you among the stars!

- The Pulsar Team

---

- Added a new feature to Search for Pulsar's settings
- Updated the completions provided by `autocomplete-css` to be as bleeding edge as possible.
- Updated the instructions and look of the login flow for the `github` package.
- Snippet transformations no longer have an implied global flag, bringing them into compatibility with snippets in most other editors.
- Snippets can now be given command names instead of tab triggers, and thus can now be assigned to key shortcuts in `keymap.cson`.
