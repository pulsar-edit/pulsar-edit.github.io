## Development

The package manifest provides several scripts to help during development:

### `dev`

Starts a watch task that will rebuild VuePress whenever a change has been made to the included Markdown and JavaScript files. Additionally, it launches the development server to test the results in the browser.

### `build`

Creates an optimized production build.

### `format`

Runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io) over all Markdown files included in the repository to ensure consistent formatting.

**Note:** This task will run automatically on every commit, so it can be ignored in most cases

### `lint`

Lints all Markdown files in the repository.

**Note:** This task will run automatically on every commit, so it can be ignored in most cases
