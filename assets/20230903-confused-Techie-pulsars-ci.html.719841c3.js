We could then realistically estimate that building Pulsar binaries will cost ~$350 USD a month.</p><p>Which when we consider that&#39;s a higher price than anything the Pulsar team spends any money on for Pulsar, it&#39;s a bit of a tough pill to swallow. But especially because Cirrus isn&#39;t the only service out there, no one on the team could justify spending our sponsor&#39;s money on such a large expense. At this point, we had to determine a way to lower our usage or move off the platform.</p><p>But to move off Cirrus, we had to consider everything it currently does for us:</p><ul><li>Builds binaries on every Pull Request</li><li>Builds our Regular Release Binaires</li><li>Builds our Rolling Release Binaries (on every commit to <code>master</code>)</li><li>Acts as a CDN for our Rolling Release Binaries (The <code>download</code> microservice redirects downloads directly to Cirrus)</li></ul><p>At this point, with the above knowledge, we had several different solutions to jugle and consider:</p><ul><li>We could move to another CI platform, but Cirrus is one of the cheaper ones</li><li>We could move most of our process to GitHub Actions</li><li>We could move everything to non-CI services, such as cloud hosted VMs</li><li>We could store binaires in other cloud storage services, such as GCP or Digital Ocean</li><li>We could slim down our Cirrus usage as much as possible</li></ul>",8),C={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/682",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A=t("p",null,"While this did solve a few of our needs from above, it didn't solve all of them, and introduced its own issues.",-1),S={href:"https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},P=i("<p>In finding a solution to our platform support issue, we looked at quite a few possibilities, at a point we were even considering purchasing an Apple Silicon Mac, second hand, and using GitHub Self Hosted Runners to build there. But of course the simplest answer, would be to only build Apple Silicon on Cirrus, but we had to consider what that would actually come out to. Looking at using all 50 free credits for building only Apple Silicon binaries, would mean getting up to 833.333 minutes within Cirrus, but we had to compare those minutes into what we could acheive:</p><p><strong>Typical Apple Silicon task run lengths</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Run Type</th><th>Length in Minutes</th><th>Task runs/month</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shortest Recorded</td><td>14.35</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>17.947</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td>17.292</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Longest Recorded</td><td>26.6</td><td>31</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So we could estimate to say we could have anywhere from 31-58 macOS runs per month (including re-runs for failures), but that shooting for ~30 macOS runs per month is a safer conservative estimate.</p><p>But, all of this above doesn&#39;t account for our ARM Linux runs, that also must stay at Cirrus CI. So we had to consider, within our 50 free credits per month that would get us 8333.333 minutes of Linux builds per month (Which that is not a typo, we are able to get 10x the amount of real-world macOS minutes compared to ARM Linux):</p><p><strong>Typical ARM Linux task run lengths</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Run Type</th><th>Length in Minutes</th><th>Task runs/month</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shortest Recorded</td><td>28.367</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td>30.208</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>32.114</td><td>259</td></tr><tr><td>Longest Recorded</td><td>45.883</td><td>181</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So while it seems we could build these platforms on Cirrus, there was temporarily a concern about if we could choose only one, to keep at our current pace, at this point we had to try and find if we should give any specific platform any priority, to which we turned to our install numbers (gathered from the logs of the <code>download</code> microservice):</p><p><strong>Rolling Release Download count by Platform over the past 30 days</strong>:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th>Download Count</th><th>Download Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple Silicon</td><td>860</td><td>15.59%</td></tr><tr><td>ARM Linux</td><td>109</td><td>1.97%</td></tr><tr><td>Windows</td><td>2,370</td><td>42.98%</td></tr><tr><td>Intel Mac</td><td>550</td><td>9.97%</td></tr><tr><td>Linux</td><td>1,624</td><td>29.45%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With this, we could easily see that if one platform must be prioritized, the numbers say that priority should be given to Apple Silicon, even though, we knew we didn&#39;t want to play favourites with platforms.</p><p>It was at this point, we had to break down how many runs we could do for both platforms. If we assume each <strong>build</strong> is one Apple Silicon macOS run and one ARM Linux run:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Credit-Cost Build Type</th><th>Credits</th><th>Builds/month</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Lowest Recorded</td><td>1.032</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td>1.256</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>1.269</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Highest Recorded</td><td>1.766</td><td>28</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With these exact numbers of our current trends, we could then assume we have an allotment of 28 builds per month for these platforms. But consdering the possible need of retries, or a build erroring out, we had settled on building Apple Silicon, and ARM Linux once every other day. Which should give us about 15 builds per month minimum. This would give us a healthy buffer zone, or any retries needed, and the ability to do another run for the regular release every month.</p><p>But even though we now knew what we needed to do, there was still a long list of things we had to change to get there, especially now considering our deadline to do so was only a few days away.</p><p>After a flurry of PRs and lots of testing, the Pulsar team was able to accomplish all of the following in just under our 5 day limit:</p><ul><li>Migrated all other platforms over to GitHub Actions</li><li>Ensure binaries are easily downloadable via GitHub Actions for testing purposes</li><li>Configure CRON jobs within Cirrus to build these platforms every two days</li><li>Minimize the amount of times Cirrus would run, ensuring to only run if changes were present, and disallow any other type of run that may occur</li><li>Setup a brand new repository <code>pulsar-rolling-releases</code> to act as the CDN for every single rolling release</li><li>Nearly completely rewrite the <code>download</code> microservice to now use this new repository to retreive the newest rolling release</li></ul>",17),R={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar-rolling-releases",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=t("code",null,"download",-1),L=t("code",null,"pulsar-rolling-releases",-1),T=t("h2",{id:"summary",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#summary","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Summary")],-1),I={href:"https://github.com/DeeDeeG",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function M(B,D){const o=d("ExternalLinkIcon");return a(),n("div",null,[u,l(" more "),c,t("p",null,[e("On August 17, 2022 "),t("a",p,[e("@mauricioszabo"),r(o)]),e(),t("a",g,[e("introduced"),r(o)]),e(" and created Pulsar's integration with "),t("a",f,[e("CirrusCI"),r(o)]),e(".
