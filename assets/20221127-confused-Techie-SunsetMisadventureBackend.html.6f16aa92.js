With constant errors, crashes, and generally just failing to respond, it was clear things were nearing an end. Even worse was that when it would work, it was inundated with thousands of Spam packages. In the days after my initial archive, the original Package Repository had ballooned with spam packages now with their total packages totaling in... well. I just can&#39;t quite say. Even now during the time of writing I&#39;ve spent ten minutes refreshing <code>Atom.io/packages</code> and it won&#39;t stop timing out or returning 500 errors. But for the sake of my point, I&#39;ve kept trying, to confirm that the original Package Repository has ballooned with spam packages now to contain 405,137 Packages. But remember when I did my initial archival there were only 12,470. Just to convey how much spam this is, and how ridiculous it is that the service turned into this immediately after the announcement.</p><p>But the last hardest part of this stage was the problems that I created for myself.</p><p>Now you see, up until this point I&#39;ve never had to worry about handling this much data. It wasn&#39;t until it was too late did I find out that my methodology was ill-fitting. I had written a nearly complete feature parity Backend for the Atom Package Repository, that expected all of its data to be JSON. Now anyone that&#39;s done this before will say that was a dumb choice, but forgive me for only being smaller scale prior. The excitement of being nearly done immediately faded, when I got the new backend running in the cloud, and threw all of my data at it.
