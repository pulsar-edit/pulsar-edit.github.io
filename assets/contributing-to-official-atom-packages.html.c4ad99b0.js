What happens if you temporarily break something? You don&#39;t want the version of Atom you&#39;re using to edit to become useless in the process. For this reason, you&#39;ll only want to load packages in <strong>development mode</strong> while you are working on them. You&#39;ll perform your editing in <strong>stable mode</strong>, only switching to development mode to test your changes.</p><p>To open a development mode window, use the &quot;Application: Open Dev&quot; command. You can also run dev mode from the command line with <code>atom --dev</code>.</p><p>To load your package in development mode, create a symlink to it in <code>~/.atom/dev/packages</code>. This occurs automatically when you clone the package with <code>apm develop</code>. You can also run <code>apm link --dev</code> and <code>apm unlink --dev</code> from the package directory to create and remove dev-mode symlinks.</p><h5 id="installing-dependencies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#installing-dependencies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Installing Dependencies</h5><p>You&#39;ll want to keep dependencies up to date by running <code>apm update</code> after pulling any upstream changes.</p>`,12);function k(b,y){const i=a("ExternalLinkIcon"),t=a("RouterLink");return c(),s("div",null,[u,n("p",null,[e("If you think you know which package is causing the issue you are reporting, feel free to open up the issue in that specific repository instead.
