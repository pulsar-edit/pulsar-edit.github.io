Essentially, it was possible to set scopes in such a way that, although permissions were technically granted, Pulsar was unable to read the scopes and refused to log in. To solve this, we have updated the package to provide feedback and improved the scope checking logic. We also updated the link to the Personal Access Token page to include by default the scopes that Pulsar requires.</p><p>Continuing with the theme of last month&#39;s new &quot;UI&quot; API, we have another new API that all packages can now take advantage of. This time it is <code>ui.fuzzyMatcher</code> which will allow packages to use Pulsar&#39;s <code>fuzzy-finder</code> module without needing to bundle it into their own packages.</p><p>And to finish off with a bug fix, an issue was found where Pulsar wasn&#39;t correctly inheriting the directory from which the <code>pulsar</code> binary was being run, leading to some slightly odd behaviour.</p><p>It is hard to believe that it has been an entire year since we created our first tagged release of Pulsar and we never would have managed to get to this milestone without the amazing support from our donors and our community, so as ever, a massive thank you to everyone who has allowed us to get this far!</p><p>Until next time (and next year!), happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!</p><ul><li>The Pulsar Team</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Fixed github package not giving feedback when a token with the wrong scopes was entered, tweak scope-checking logic to match expectations, and log incorrect scopes.</li><li>Various cleanups, maintenance and upkeep of the PPM repo.</li><li>Added options for a user to control when to automatically show or hide the wrap-guide;
