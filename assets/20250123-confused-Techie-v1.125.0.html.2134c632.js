This does mean that by default comments in code are no longer spell-checked \u2014 but if you liked the feature, you can add that setting back in! Just re-add <code>source comment</code> to the list of scopes under &quot;Settings &gt; Packages &gt; spell-check &gt; Grammars.&quot;</p><p>We&#39;ve also restored an internal API that was changed a while back, after we learned the change affected the <code>project-plus</code> community package.</p><p>We have our usual improvements to the Tree-sitter grammars \u2014 such as <code>language-css</code>&#39;s parser being updated to the latest, and <code>language-python</code> getting improved indentation hinting for some unusual code constructs.</p><p>We&#39;ve fixed an issue that would cause <code>pulsar</code> and <code>ppm</code> to be removed from the user&#39;s PATH on Windows during an upgrade, to ensure the choices you select during installation are respected.</p><p>We&#39;ve also engaged in some maintenance and updates to our CI operations, to ensure we can keep things working on all of our supported platforms.</p><p>As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations. Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars! - The Pulsar Team</p><hr>',9),h=r("<li>The Windows installer no longer removes <code>pulsar</code> and <code>ppm</code> from your path when you update Pulsar to a newer version.</li><li>[spell-check] Removed <code>source comment</code> from the list of automatically checked scopes because of reports of high CPU usage. This means that Pulsar will no longer automatically perform spell-checking for all code comments in all source files. (If you liked the behavior, you can add it back to the list in the <code>spell-check.grammars</code> config setting.)</li><li>[language-python] Improved indentation hinting in some unusual scenarios like on one-line blocks and after code comments.</li><li>[language-css] Updated <code>tree-sitter-css</code> to latest. Selector handling is now much better when typing incomplete selectors in a brand-new CSS file or at the bottom of an existing file.</li>",4),m={href:"https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/project-plus",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g=e("h3",{id:"pulsar",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#pulsar","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" Pulsar")],-1),f={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1172",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},_={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1183",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1178",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1193",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1192",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},y={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1188",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},w=e("code",null,"dbPromise",-1),P=e("code",null,"StateStore",-1),x={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1171",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T=e("h3",{id:"pulsar-updater",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#pulsar-updater","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" pulsar-updater")],-1),I={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1185",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},C=e("h3",{id:"spell-check",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#spell-check","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" spell-check")],-1),S={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1173",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function W(N,A){const o=c("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),l("div",null,[e("p",null,[t("Pulsar "),e("a",d,[t("1.125.0"),a(o)]),t(" is available now!")]),i(" more "),p,e("ul",null,[h,e("li",null,[t("Restored functionality of "),e("a",m,[t("project-plus"),a(o)]),t(" via exposing previously removed internal APIs.")])]),g,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("Tree-sitter rolling fixes, 1.125 (or 1.124.1) edition "),e("a",f,[t("@savetheclocktower"),a(o)])]),e("li",null,[t("Windows: Only remove Pulsar/PPM from PATH during uninstall "),e("a",_,[t("@confused-Techie"),a(o)])]),e("li",null,[t("CI: Retry on timeout when building macOS bins "),e("a",b,[t("@DeeDeeG"),a(o)])]),e("li",null,[t("Install dependencies for CI documentation job "),e("a",k,[t("@savetheclocktower"),a(o)])]),e("li",null,[t("Attempt to install dependency on new Ubuntu CI images "),e("a",v,[t("@savetheclocktower"),a(o)])]),e("li",null,[t("CI: No dpkg shenanigans for package tests workflow "),e("a",y,[t("@DeeDeeG"),a(o)])]),e("li",null,[t("Expose "),w,t(" in "),P,t(),e("a",x,[t("@confused-Techie"),a(o)])])]),T,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("Don't prompt to update on non-default release channels "),e("a",I,[t("@savetheclocktower"),a(o)])])]),C,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("Fixes for a possible patch release "),e("a",S,[t("@savetheclocktower"),a(o)])])])])}const D=n(u,[["render",W],["__file","20250123-confused-Techie-v1.125.0.html.vue"]]);export{D as default};
