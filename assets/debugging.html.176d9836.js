Atom will also execute the code in your <a href="/hacking-atom/sections/the-init-file">init script</a> on startup. In some cases, these packages and the code in the init script might be causing unexpected behavior, problems, or performance issues.</p><p>To determine if that is happening, start Atom from the terminal in safe mode:</p><div class="language-command-line ext-command-line line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-command-line"><code>$ atom --safe

If you can no longer reproduce the problem in safe mode, it&#39;s likely it was caused by one of the packages or the init script.</p><p>If removing or commenting out all content from the init script and starting Atom normally still produces the error, then try figuring out which package is causing trouble. Start Atom normally again and open the Settings View with <kbd class="platform-mac">Cmd+,</kbd><kbd class="platform-windows platform-linux">Ctrl+,</kbd>.
