Any issues found here will be important to address, in order to ensure future updates go smoothly, and to unblock the road to compatibility with newer Electron versions. Please let us know if you find anything broken due to these updates!</p><p>We also have updates such as improved whitespace in a certain PHP snippet, and bleeding edge HTML completions. And with more decaf work, we should be seeing some slightly faster startup speeds.</p><p>Last but not least, we can expect to see this release being available on Chocolatey for Windows; Thank you HighHarmonics, il_mix, and COLAMAroro!</p><p>But as always we want to say a huge thanks to all those that contribute and donate to Pulsar, making it possible for us to continually release these improvements. And we want to give a special thanks to the new faces we are seeing in this update, with some brand new contributors!</p><p>As always we appreciate every single one of you, happy coding, and see you among the stars!</p><ul><li>The Pulsar Team</li></ul><hr><ul><li>The settings-view package now lists a package\u2019s snippets more accurately</li><li>Fixed some issues with some packages with WebComponents v0 (tablr package<br> should work now) by internalizing and patching document-register-element</li><li>Migrated away from <code>node-oniguruma</code> in favor of <code>vscode-oniguruma</code> (WASM<br> version). This fixes issues with Electron 21</li><li>Ensured new WASM packages will work on Apple Silicon</li><li>Completions for HTML will now be as bleeding edge as possible.</li></ul><h3 id="pulsar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pulsar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pulsar</h3>',12),c=e("code",null,"settings-view",-1),m={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/451",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},_={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/488",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/483",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=e("code",null,"wrap-guide",-1),b={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/443",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/424",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},w={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/454",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/471",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/463",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},y={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/406",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/446",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},S=e("code",null,"autocomplete-html",-1),C=e("code",null,"completions.json",-1),P={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/405",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/450",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},M={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/438",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},U={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/435",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},W={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/440",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},E={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/414",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/434",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},R={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/239",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},z={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/432",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},B=e("h3",{id:"second-mate",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#second-mate","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" second-mate")],-1),D={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/second-mate/pull/1",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},N=e("h3",{id:"autosave",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#autosave","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" autosave")],-1),V={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/autosave/pull/2",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},H={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/autosave/pull/1",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},L=e("h3",{id:"bracket-matcher",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#bracket-matcher","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" bracket-matcher")],-1),I={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/bracket-matcher/pull/3",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},j={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/bracket-matcher/pull/2",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},O={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/bracket-matcher/pull/1",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},q=e("h3",{id:"timecop",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#timecop","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" timecop")],-1),G={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/timecop/pull/1",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},J=e("h3",{id:"keybinding-resolver",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#keybinding-resolver","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" keybinding-resolver")],-1),Y={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/keybinding-resolver/pull/1",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function K(Q,X){const r=d("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),l("div",null,[e("p",null,[t("Check out our newest Regular Release for Pulsar!
