We&#39;ve been kicking back a bit ourselves, but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have any new updates to share with you!</p><p>Whether you&#39;re celebrating end-of-year holidays in the cold of Winter, or the heat of Summer (depending on what hemisphere you live in!) Pulsar is here to warm your heart with another Regular release.</p><p>We&#39;ve made it possible for spellcheck to activate in more fine-grained scopes, and turned it on for code comments by default. <em>(Now with fewer typos in comments!)</em> If you&#39;d like to disable spell checking in comments, navigate to <code>Settings &gt; spell-check &gt; grammars</code> and remove <code>source comment</code>, or delete <code>source comment</code> from <code>spell-check.grammars</code> in your config file.</p><p>We&#39;ve tweaked and refined some aspects of our Tree-sitter usage, as usual. With a fix for C++, and another under-the-hood fix as well.</p><p>We&#39;ve ensured that keybinds should show for every package in <code>settings-view</code>, fixing a bug that prevented any keybinds from showing when keybinds were available for OSes/platforms other than the one currently in use.</p><p>We&#39;ve cleaned up an outdated error message that you might see when moving items to the trash on Linux.</p><p>And we&#39;ve engaged in a bit of maintenance around our CI operations as usual, and made building Pulsar a bit faster by skipping generation of blockmap files that we currently don&#39;t make use of.</p><p>As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations. Happy coding, and see you amongst the stars. - The Pulsar Team</p><hr><ul><li>Enhanced spellcheck to allow spellchecking on sections of a buffer.
