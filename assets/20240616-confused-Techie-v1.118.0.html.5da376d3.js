This release brings lots of love to syntax highlighting, along with a zesty sprinkling of features and fixes.</p><p>We&#39;ve got Tree-sitter fixes and improvements, including improved documentation around Tree-sitter&#39;s usage, an updated PHP parser, fixed syntax quoting on Clojure, as well as enhanced Clojure highlighting support for metadata and &quot;def&quot; elements, as well as improved injection points for Clojure. EDN files are back to being detected as Clojure, but will highlight correctly as EDN. Tasty!</p><p>Within the Pulsar application the new setting <code>core.allowWindowTransparency</code> lets users set the background of the editor to support transparency, although transparent CSS styles must be set by a theme or user stylesheet for Pulsar to actually be transparent. The <code>textChanged</code> property is now accurate when characters are deleted.</p><p>The Tree-sitter syntax highlighting system now has a new test for queries <code>ancestorTypeNearerThan</code> which helps matching the <em>first</em> type as an ancestor, as well as supporting a second <code>buffer</code> argument in the <code>content</code> field of <code>addInjectionPoint</code> for easier customization.</p><p>Finally, for our community package developers, they will be glad to hear that first time publication issues have been resolved with a rewrite of the <code>ppm publish</code> command, improving the workflow, and ensuring things work properly with the updated backend. Please feel free to share what you&#39;ve been cooking by publishing your packages!</p><p>As always, thanks a ton to all of our users and supporters for sticking with the Pulsar project, and until next time, happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!</p><p>- The Pulsar Team</p><hr><ul><li>Various tree-sitter grammar improvements <ul><li>Docs fixes</li><li>A parser update for PHP</li><li>Miscellaneous grammar fixes and improvements</li></ul></li><li>Added a preference <code>core.allowWindowTransparency</code> so that themes and user stylesheets can make editor windows&#39; backgrounds transparent.</li><li>Added a new modern tree sitter &quot;test&quot; for highlight query - <code>ancestorTypeNearerThan</code> that matches if it finds the <em>first</em> type as an ancestor, but <em>doesn&#39;t match</em> if any &quot;other&quot; ancestors are found before</li><li>Syntax quoting and unquoting in Clojure now highlights correctly, and also highlights full qualified keywords differently than generated ones</li><li><code>content</code> field of addInjectionPoint for modern-tree-sitter now supports a second <code>buffer</code> argument, for better customization if one wants to</li><li>EDN is back to being detected as Clojure (for compatibility) but highlights as EDN</li><li>Fixed syntax quoting on Clojure grammar (newer tree-sitter), fixed some injection points on Clojure.
