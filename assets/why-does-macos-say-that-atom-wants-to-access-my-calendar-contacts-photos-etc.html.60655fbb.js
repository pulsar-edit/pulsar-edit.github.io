Whenever an application attempts to access the files inside certain newly-protected directories, macOS asks the user whether they want to allow the application to access the content in those directories. These new privacy protections apply to the directories that contain your calendars, contacts, photos, mail, messages, and Time Machine backups.</p><p>Applications trigger these new macOS prompts when attempting to access these directories in any way. Simply attempting to <em>list</em> the files in one of these directories is enough to trigger these prompts. These protections even apply to Apple&#39;s own applications. For example, if you open <code>Terminal.app</code> and try to list the files in <code>~/Library/Calendars</code>, macOS shows a prompt saying, &#39;&quot;Terminal&quot; would like access to your calendar.&#39;</p><img width="602" alt="screen shot 2018-10-03 at 14 04 40 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2988/46432184-9bfe9f80-c71b-11e8-8916-e844b7f4110e.png"><h4 id="why-does-atom-need-access-to-my-calendar-contacts-photos-etc" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-atom-need-access-to-my-calendar-contacts-photos-etc" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does Atom need access to my calendar, contacts, photos, etc.?</h4>',5),d=t("code",null,"~",-1),p={href:"https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/#opening-a-file-in-a-project",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=t("img",{width:"1030",alt:"fuzzy-finder can trigger prompt",src:"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2988/46432185-9bfe9f80-c71b-11e8-83f7-758c3212d16c.png"},null,-1),y={href:"https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/find-and-replace/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},u=s('<p>In addition to containing the files you&#39;re <em>intending</em> to edit inside Atom, your home directory also contains your files that have new OS-level protections in Mojave:</p><ul><li>Calendar files (<code>~/Library/Calendars</code>)</li><li>Contacts files (<code>~/Library/Application\\ Support/AddressBook</code></li><li>Mail files (<code>~/Library/Mail</code>)</li><li>Photos files (<code>~/Pictures/Photos\\ Library.photoslibrary</code>)</li></ul><p>Before letting Atom read these files, Mojave is understandably asking whether you want Atom to be able to access this personal data.</p><h4 id="what-should-i-do-when-i-see-these-prompts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-should-i-do-when-i-see-these-prompts" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What should I do when I see these prompts?</h4><p>Most people don&#39;t use Atom to view or edit their calendar files, contact files, photo library, etc. If you don&#39;t intend to use Atom to view/edit these files, then Atom doesn&#39;t need access to them.

Atom treats them exactly like any other file you would view in Atom. Therefore, if you allow Atom to access these items, you&#39;ll be able to use Atom to browse the directories that contain these items, and you&#39;ll be able to view the files in those directories. That&#39;s it. Nothing more.</p><h4 id="you-ll-only-be-prompted-once" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#you-ll-only-be-prompted-once" aria-hidden="true">#</a> You&#39;ll only be prompted once</h4><p>Fortunately, macOS will only prompt you once for each type of personal data.
