We now properly support block comments, quotes and a bunch of other advanced features. Basically there has never been a better time to pick up learning Clojure in Pulsar!</p><p>Don&#39;t let these big updates make you assume we aren&#39;t also thinking about some smaller scale things, we have a tiny quality of life update to our GitHub package which adds a <code>Log Out</code> option to the package options (<code>Packages &gt; GitHub &gt; Log Out</code>) (previously only available in a somewhat obscure command - <code>github:logout</code>) - just beware that this will remove your token from your system entirely so you will either need to re-enter it or create a new one to log back in.</p><p>And of course to finish up we have some annoying bugs which we have now been squashed, for example an issue that prevented images opening correctly (an issue we apparently inherited from Atom) and, whilst not a bug, a fix to solve a less than ideal situation with our new CSS autocomplete implementation to sort the suggestions in a more expected fashion. We have to thank our community for these as these last couple of items as they were brought to our attention (and in one case fixed) by some of our community members.</p><p>So that just about wraps it up for another release. As ever a huge thank you to our wonderful community and donors who make this entire project possible.</p><p>Till next time, happy coding, and see you among the stars!</p><ul><li>The Pulsar Team</li></ul><details><summary>A quick note about our missing ARM Linux Binaries</summary> Sorry, there are no ARM Linux binaries at time of initial release, due to what we suspect is an issue at our CI provider.
