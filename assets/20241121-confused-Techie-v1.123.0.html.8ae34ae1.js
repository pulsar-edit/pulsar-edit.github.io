But don&#39;t fret, there&#39;s still a healthy mix of new features, such as the symbols-view package allowing project-wide symbol search from multiple providers, as well as our consistent improvements to the new Tree-sitter implementation.</p><p>All-in-all we hope there&#39;s something for everyone this release. As always, a huge thank you to our community, contributors, and donations.
