If you&#39;re working with a document that has mixed whitespace, these commands are great for helping to normalize the file. There are no keybindings for the whitespace commands, so you will have to search your command palette for &quot;Convert Spaces to Tabs&quot; (or vice versa) to run one of these commands.</p>',6),A={href:"https://github.com/atom/whitespace",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T=e("code",null,"whitespace",-1),D=o('<p><img src="'+m+'" alt="Managing your whitespace settings"></p><div class="custom-container note"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>The &quot;Remove Trailing Whitespace&quot; option is on by default.
