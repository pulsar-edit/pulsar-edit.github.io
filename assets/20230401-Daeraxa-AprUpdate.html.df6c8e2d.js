Most people will probably only use this by interacting with the packages menu inside Pulsar but <code>ppm</code> is also supplied as a command line applications accessible via either <code>ppm</code> or <code>pulsar -p</code>. One issue with this approach is that we have to account for all of the different OSs and packaging methods which means adding it to <code>$PATH</code> correctly on each OS etc. (This was even an issue with Atom which had a special macOS only command to install the <code>apm</code> command line again).</p><p>With this change we hopefully avoid all of this as it is simply part of the main <code>pulsar</code> executable so we only have to account for the details of one application and not two.
