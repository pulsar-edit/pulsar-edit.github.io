It created an API to make packages, but together with this API, it also allowed authors to use web APIs together with node.js packages, modules (including &quot;native modules&quot; - more on that later) and, finally, a special API that was used to communicate between the &quot;main module&quot; and the &quot;browser part&quot;.</p><p>That last part, eventually, split from Atom and became Electron. And for a while, the Atom development was tied to the Electron one, meaning that an update on Atom usually meant an update on Electron, and vice-versa.</p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case for a long time...</p><h2 id="a-little-bit-of-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-little-bit-of-history" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A little bit of history</h2><p>The latest version of Atom was pulled because of some certificate issues; that means the <em>real latest</em> stable version of Atom was 1.60.0.</p><p>This version of Atom used Electron 9.3.5. For comparison, at the time, Electron was at version 22, but the &quot;master&quot; branch of Atom (and atom-community) was at version 11.5.0.</p><p>The first thing we did was to find the greatest version that would give us some kind of benefit, but also that we could make work. Luckily for us, the only breaking change on Electron 12 was that some crash analytics changed, and considering we would not use that anymore (because we decided to remove all telemetry) we decided to bump 12.2.3 - the version we&#39;re at today.</p><p>This might not seem that much of a change, but Electron 12 gave us native macOS ARM binaries, and allowed us to use Playwright to test the editor - enabling what we called &quot;visual tests&quot; on our CI (the actual unit and integration tests from Atom, at the time, were not running reliably in our CI, so these visual tests allowed us to have some feedback if we broke anything).</p><h2 id="the-quest-for-electron-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-quest-for-electron-13" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The quest for Electron 13</h2><p>The next step was to bump to Electron 13.

That basically translates to editing text - so, basically, <em>the most important</em> library that we have.</p><p>This library is also a &quot;native library&quot; - meaning that it&#39;s written on a lower-level language (C++, in this case) and that it integrates with the Node.JS code via some bindings to the runtime. These bindings basically change all the time on Node.JS, but that&#39;s not the worst part.</p><p>The worst part is that they change even more agressively on Electron. Because in C, and C++, you manipulate memory manually, and because we&#39;re now in a &quot;browser environment&quot; (Electron) some changes are being pushed to avoid corrupting memory, accessing places that we&#39;re not supposed to access, and to make these libraries &quot;play nice&quot; in multiple contexts - meaning, one instance of the &quot;browser&quot; not corrupting the memory of another instance (in our case, this translates to one editor window not corrupting another). Superstring was not ready to be used in the state it was, because it <em>manually copied memory</em> from places.</p><p>Fortunately, we found a fix - there was an experimental, and incomplete, version of Superstring that compiled to Web Assembly - that means a new format that <em>every browser</em> should run without any problem, and that&#39;s how we ported Superstring to run newer Electron.... for a while.</p><h2 id="more-things-break" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-things-break" aria-hidden="true">#</a> More things break</h2><p>Our syntax highlighter tree-sitter also didn&#39;t work on newer Electron version - on Electron 14, it stopped working completely. So, for the time being, we disabled it, and kept trying to port things, fix stuff, etc. Fortunately, all other libraries were ready to be used in newer Electron contexts, and we just had to fix some &quot;synchronous&quot; calls to be &quot;asynchronous&quot; and that worked.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t that worried about disabling tree-sitter because, at the time, we were already trying to make a modern tree-sitter implementation, so I knew that sometime in the future, we could re-enable tree-sitter and that it would work (spoiler alert: <strong>it DID!</strong>).</p><p>Then I got greedy, and decided to make Pulsar work in the newest Electron at the time - Electron 23.</p><h2 id="things-work-fine-juuuust-kidding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#things-work-fine-juuuust-kidding" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Things work fine! (juuuust kidding!)</h2><p>Well, if you have been following the tone of this post... of course you know what happens next, right?</p><p>Electron 21 enabled something called <em>V8 memory cage</em>. I honestly don&#39;t fully understand that that means, but what ended up happening is that <em>another native library</em> was crashing the editor - and the name of the library is Oniguruma.</p><p>If you&#39;re not aware of what this is, it&#39;s a regular expression library. If you <em>also don&#39;t know</em> what that is, basically is the library used in TextMate grammars to do syntax highlighting.</p><p>So, summarizing: Atom (and by definition, Pulsar) had two ways of highlighting code (coloring the keywords, functions, classes, methods, etc): one is called tree-sitter, that breaks in Electron 14, and another callled TextMate, that breaks in Electron 21...</p><p>...great.</p><p>A code editor without syntax highlighting is probably not a good idea at all; we could not disable it and basically offer no syntax highlighting library.
