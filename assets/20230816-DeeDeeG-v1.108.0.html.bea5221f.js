When we started the Pulsar project, one of the first things we did was rename the &quot;Atom Package Manager&quot; to the &quot;Pulsar Package Manager&quot; for obvious reasons. However, under the hood, you would still find <code>apm</code> binaries and files; this was particularly relevant for Windows users, for which there was no automatic <code>PATH</code> registration. The good news is that we have begun the transition to change them. For the time being, <code>apm</code> will remain alongside <code>ppm</code> until we can be sure we haven&#39;t hit any unforeseen issues.</p><p>And with that, we bring this to a close. As ever, a huge thank you to all of our community members and especially our donors, without whom this project just wouldn&#39;t be possible.</p><p>Until next time, happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!</p><ul><li>The Pulsar Team</li></ul><hr><h3 id="changelog" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#changelog" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Changelog</h3><ul><li>Restored ability for <code>less</code> files in packages to use inline JavaScript inside backticks.</li><li>Fixed a syntax highlighting issue inside the <code>styleguide</code> package.</li><li>Fixed an issue with rubygems timing out on ARM Linux workflow.</li><li>Rewrote Tree-sitter scope predicates to use <code>#is?</code> and <code>#is-not?</code> where applicable.</li><li>Ensure that project-specific setting overrides don&#39;t leak to the user&#39;s config file when the settings UI is visited.</li><li>Added a feature in <code>markdown-preview</code> that adds support for Linguist, Chroma, Rouge, and HighlightJS for language identifiers in fenced code blocks.</li><li>Fixed the <code>TextMate</code> <code>language-toml</code> grammar to properly support whitespace where-ever it may appear.</li><li>Added a Tree-Sitter grammar for YAML files.</li><li>Added a new core package <code>pulsar-updater</code> to help users update Pulsar.</li><li>Added <code>ppm</code> and <code>ppm.cmd</code> binaries/launchers within ppm.
