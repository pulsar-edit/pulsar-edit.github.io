I think it is safe to say that this month has been one of our more eventful due to the switchover we made to the new Tree-sitter implementation.

This implementation did contain a couple of small oversights, which have now been resolved. One issue with the markdown implementation was the display of non-functional heading anchors when rendering a package README; the other was a small rendering bug that was causing a misalignment of content after a linebreak. We had also inadvertently introduced a new problem with <code>fuzzymatcher</code> that could cause the command palette to hang if it failed to highlight a match.</p><p>One issue raised a while ago was that, starting with Pulsar 1.109.0, users of older LTS Linux distributions, such as AlmaLinux 8 and RockyLinux 9, were no longer able to run Pulsar. This was due to the CI runners we use being updated to newer OSs, and therefore Pulsar was being compiled against a newer version of <code>glibc</code>. We have changed our workflows to compile Pulsar in a Debian 10 Docker container instead, which should resolve this problem.</p><p>It was noticed a while ago that the <code>github</code> package wasn&#39;t quite working correctly on ARM Linux systems. We have bumped the version of <code>dugite</code> (a library for using <code>git</code> in NodeJS and Electron) to resolve the problem.</p><p>Lastly, we have two new features in <code>ppm</code>. The first is a new flag <code>--force</code> that can be specified on <code>ppm link</code>, which will forcibly replace a conflicting package without needing to manually remove it. The other is an update to <code>ppm</code>&#39;s syntax theme template so that, when generating a new syntax theme, it now includes some style variables that the editor has long supported, but which were not in the template, so theme authors might have been unaware of them. (As a bonus: there are two <em>new</em> variables supported by default in the editor, and added to the template as well! Theme authors, feel free to take advantage of these!)</p><p>And that is it for yet another Pulsar release. We hope you enjoy this release and look forward to the next one!</p><p>Until next time, happy coding, and see you amongst the stars!</p><ul><li>The Pulsar team</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Prevented an exception raised in the command palette in certain unusual filtering scenarios.</li><li>Refrain from rendering anchor icons when showing a package&#39;s README file in <code>settings-view</code>.</li><li>Build Linux binaries on Debian 10, for older glibc and compatibility with older Linux distros.</li><li>Fixed a rendering error in <code>atom.ui.markdown.render</code> when <code>disableMode</code> was set to <code>&quot;strict&quot;</code> and the input contained HTML line breaks.</li><li>Added support for the semanticolor package in modern tree-sitter grammars.</li><li>Added new <code>--force</code> flag to <code>ppm link</code> command that will uninstall any conflicting package already installed.</li><li>Added language entity colors to <code>syntax-variables.less</code>.</li><li>Numerous Tree-Sitter Grammar syntax highlighting fixes.</li><li>Bumped dugite to make the github package compatible with ARM Linux.</li></ul><h3 id="pulsar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pulsar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pulsar</h3>',10),b={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/860",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},_={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/889",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},w={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/891",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/870",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/858",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/859",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},y={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/902",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},D={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/905",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/908",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/903",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/901",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},U={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/913",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},L=e("code",null,"symbols-view",-1),P={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/861",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},E={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/906",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},M=e("code",null,"GITHUB_TOKEN",-1),I={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/924",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},R={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/925",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},G={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/926",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},B=e("h3",{id:"ppm",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#ppm","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" PPM")],-1),N={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/124",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},S={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/123",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},V={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/122",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},W=e("h3",{id:"github",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#github","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" github")],-1),C={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/github/pull/39",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function O(q,z){const a=d("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),i("div",null,[e("p",null,[t("Pulsar "),e("a",u,[t("1.114.0"),r(a)]),t(" is available now!")]),l(" more "),p,c,e("p",null,[t("As mentioned above, we have quite a few changes relating to our new Tree-sitter implementation that we made default in Pulsar 1.113.0.
