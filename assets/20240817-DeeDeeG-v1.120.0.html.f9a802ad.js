It should look better just about everywhere (on the taskbar, in the installer, Pulsar&#39;s window title bar, explorer context menu, you name it!) There&#39;s our regular Tree-sitter improvements, like indentation improvements in JavaScript and Typescript, improved syntax highlighting in TypeScript, with general improvements to code folding, and new hackability on query files. We&#39;ve enhanced the functionality of the &#39;pulsar -p&#39; switch for accessing &#39;ppm&#39;, and checked its correctness. No more printing the versions for Pulsar when you meant to print the version of &#39;ppm&#39;! Arguments / subcommands should make it safely to &#39;ppm&#39; as you intended. (On Windows -- enhancements will come to Linux and macOS soon\u2122\uFE0F!) Further with PPM stale dependencies have been removed and updated as needed. We now handle indents/leading whitespace better for all the snippets users out there! Snippet fearlessly, now with proper indentation handling! And, last but not least, we fixed a stray link in &#39;CONTRIBUTING.md&#39;.</p><p>As always thanks a ton for all of the support for the project, and we look forward to seeing you amongst the stars.</p><p>- The Pulsar Team</p><hr><ul><li>Resolved some issues of using <code>pulsar -p</code> to access <code>ppm</code> in the command line on Windows.</li><li>Added a new icon for Pulsar on Windows, increasing its visual fidelity in most locations.</li><li>[snippets] Fixed an issue with expanding snippet variables in certain scenarios if the snippet inserted new lines into the buffer.</li><li>Updated misconfigured links in the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file.</li><li>[ppm] Resolved an issue that could prevent renaming an existing package.</li><li>Various Tree-sitter improvements (folds, indents, custom queries, grammar updates...)</li></ul><h3 id="pulsar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pulsar" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pulsar</h3>',8),h={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1062",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1075",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1043",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1072",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},_=e("code",null,"pulsar -p",-1),b={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1063",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/1067",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v=e("h3",{id:"ppm",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#ppm","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" PPM")],-1),w=e("code",null,"async",-1),x={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/134",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},y={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/135",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/133",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},I={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/ppm/pull/131",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function N(D,P){const n=p("ExternalLinkIcon");return a(),i("div",null,[e("p",null,[t("Pulsar "),e("a",c,[t("1.120.0"),r(n)]),t(" is available now!")]),s(" more "),u,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t("Fixed: Tree-sitter rolling fixes 1.120 edition "),e("a",h,[t("@savetheclocktower"),r(n)])]),e("li",null,[t("Updated: ppm: Update ppm to commit d9bcff111146547e1f4dec63 "),e("a",m,[t("@DeeDeeG"),r(n)])]),e("li",null,[t("Fixed: [snippets] Fix incorrect range traversal when resolving variables "),e("a",f,[t("@savetheclocktower"),r(n)])]),e("li",null,[t("Added: [windows] Improve Icon "),e("a",g,[t("@confused-Techie"),r(n)])]),e("li",null,[t("Added: Use a different strategy for "),_,t(" on Windows...
