These milestones were never formally decided upon so we instead went with a semi-arbitrary release date of the 15th of each month simply to get these releases updated with all of our recent fixes.</li><li>These releases would be tagged <code>beta</code> or <code>latest</code> on our website to make it clear if it was a &quot;stable&quot; milestone release or a beta release candidate.</li><li>We had a second section on our page dedicated to &quot;Cirrus CI Binaries&quot;. These binaries are produced from our CI platform automatically on pushes to our <code>master</code> branch. The idea of these were that they could be treated as <code>dev</code>, <code>alpha</code> or <code>nightly</code> type releases which were potentially unstable but had the latest updates.</li></ul><p>However it became clear that this wasn&#39;t what we were actually doing. What ended up happening was that our &quot;stable&quot; releases never got a proper milestone criteria agreed upon and quickly became out of date compared to our &quot;Cirrus CI&quot; releases.<br> We also found that because all the fixes going into our <code>master</code> branch were so thoroughly reviewed and tested by both the Pulsar team and wider community, these ended up being <em>more</em> stable than the &quot;stable&quot; releases which quickly meant that, whilst our intention was correct, the reality was either incorrect or misleading.</p><p>More than a few people commented on the use of the <code>beta</code> tag meaning it was unfinished or unstable software (even more so with the <code>alpha</code> and <code>dev</code> terms used on the Cirrus builds) so were avoiding Pulsar entirely whilst they waited for a proper, stable, release which often required us to manually explain the concepts - and those are just the vocal people we heard from so we don&#39;t even know how many people got turned off from the project entirely based on this which was never our intention.<br> We also found that the very concept of the Cirrus CI binaries confused some people, particularly due to the name, so this also needed to be addressed.</p><p>So after some lengthy discussions and the aforementioned poll, we decided to address these issues by reflecting what is actually going on in practice.</p>",6),w={href:"https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g=s('<h2 id="rolling-release" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rolling-release" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Rolling Release</h2><p>The &quot;Rolling Release&quot; is the new name for what we previously called &quot;Cirrus CI Binaries&quot; and we have promoted this to the top of our downloads page to make it more obvious as we have a (soft) preference for its use - after all this is the &quot;hyper-hackable text editor&quot; and this seems to fit our mission statement nicely.</p><p>This type of release has a number of benefits for everyone:</p><ul><li>New functionality is available shortly after the relevant PR is merged. This means no waiting for a formal release milestone to include some desired features or fixes.</li><li>No formal release process is needed, we have a standard download link for each release binary that automatically pulls the very latest build from Cirrus CI.</li><li>Issues can be easily tracked to a particular PR or change because each version stamp is different for each PR so we can narrow down the problem rather easily.</li><li>Issues can be addressed quickly without the need for a formal tagged hotfix release process.</li></ul><p>Of course there are some potential drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Despite our best efforts with reviews and testing it is entirely possible that things will fall through the cracks leading to a regression or issue meaning that you would need to downgrade or swap to the Regular Release until the issue gets resolved.</li><li>Whilst we don&#39;t have automatic updates implemented yet, when we do it means that an updated version will be almost constantly shown which might be seen as a curse or blessing from your standpoint.</li></ul><h2 id="regular-releases" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#regular-releases" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Regular Releases</h2><p>This is the new name for the section previously just labelled as &quot;Releases&quot;. These have been moved down on the page but remain a valid option for those that want to use a more regular release model.<br> Currently we are sticking to a release date of the 15th of every month (which initially was just a happy coincidence but we found we liked it and makes for easy organisation) but this not guaranteed and may change as needed.</p><p>This also has some benefits for some over the rolling release:</p><ul><li>Changes from one release to the next are more obvious as we provide an easy to read changelog that shows all the new functionality and fixes.</li><li>It is a somewhat more known quantity to the Pulsar team and community when it comes to support. It is easier to remember generally what kind of changes got added in <code>v1.101.0</code> vs <code>1.101.2023021600</code>.</li><li>Fewer updates made available - if you don&#39;t need to be up to date at all times then this slower release schedule may be of benefit as you won&#39;t have to download a new binary just to get a single bugfix for something that may not affect you personally - particularly relevant when we have hopefully automatic updates available in the future.</li><li>Allows us to make consolidated announcements with the changes to keep the wider community up to date via our various social channels.</li></ul><p>Of course there are also some potential drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Fixes and features available in the Rolling Releases won&#39;t be available (unless urgent) until the next release slot. This also means that some people go to the effort of logging an issue on GitHub or in Discord only to be told that it has already been fixed.</li><li>Requires a more formal release process from the team where we have to be organized to tag and update the links which currently takes a fair amount of organization and effort from many people.</li><li>Unintentional implications that this is a &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;LTS&quot; type release over the Rolling Release. This is not the case as we consider all of our releases to be stable unless otherwise indicated and we do not support anything other than the latest released version (both Rolling and Regular).</li></ul><h2 id="what-can-i-expect-going-forwards" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-can-i-expect-going-forwards" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What can I expect going forwards?</h2>',13),y={href:"https://pulsar-edit.dev/community.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b=e("p",null,[t("One thing that we haven't addressed yet is the concept of automated updates.
