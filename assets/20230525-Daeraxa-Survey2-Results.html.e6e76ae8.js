For this we were just after some general feedback on what people like or dislike about the current docs and how it compares to other project documentation.</p><p>Whilst I can&#39;t address every comment individually, I&#39;ve picked out a few to address as they are either a common question or a great point that I think needs to be addressed:</p><h3 id="api-docs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#api-docs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> API Docs</h3><blockquote><p>api chapter needed</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whenever I&#39;ve tried to use the documentation it seems to be mostly TODO&#39;s. So, I&#39;d say that getting the content back to where it was under Atom is more important than fine tuning layout and structure (especially the API documentation).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The API, that&#39;s the most important part of the Atom project, is not accessible. I would love to have an accessible version soon, and one that is fully searchable, possibly by showing the classes and methods as more relevant and a &quot;full text search&quot; also present</p></blockquote><p>So the API stuff has been a little more challenging in terms of the documentation migration from the flight manual. It wasn&#39;t actually <em>part</em> of the flight manual but was generated from the Atom team&#39;s own API tooling which output in HTML. There were so many discussions about potential API changes and migrating to a more used/supported API docs generation tool (JSDocs) that this got left behind in fear of spending a lot of time getting it ready only to have no good way to automatically update it.<br> The good news is that the JSDoc work is well on its way so we should be able to get this added before too long.</p><h3 id="layout" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#layout" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Layout</h3><blockquote><p>Having everything as one huge page is a bit much. Maybe make the subchapters individual pages?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think everything in Launch Manual should be moved one level up</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As far as I can see this Launch Manual navigation level is not needed and would clean things up and make it more obvious where things are located by removing this level. At this time I&#39;m not certain what else to provide feedback on.</p></blockquote><p>We agree with these points and this is one of the major areas that is spurring on this rework. We don&#39;t want to do anything drastic but we do plan to make navigation a little better and less &quot;monolithic&quot;.</p><h3 id="videos" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#videos" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Videos</h3><blockquote><p>Video Tutorials</p></blockquote>',15),S={href:"https://www.youtube.com/@htmltim/videos",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},W=n('<p>We also had a bunch of comments saying they liked the current docs so we also need to take that into account rather than just going crazy and overhauling everything.</p><h2 id="community-package-publishing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community-package-publishing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Community package publishing</h2><p>Currently, in order to publish a package to the Pulsar package registry it is a requirement to make your package available in a GitHub repository. We were after info to know if this is something that is stopping any of our community from publishing packages.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="survey2-q2"></p><p>An interesting almost 50:50 split here, it makes us happy to see so many people are interested in creating packages so we will definitely take that into consideration with our documentation and processes in order to make the publishing and maintenance aspect as good as possible. I can see us asking more questions on the package development experience in the future!</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="survey2-q3"></p><p>So this was quite enlightening. It is good to know that most people aren&#39;t being put off by the current requirement but it is also great to find out that our plans to support other forges or services are in demand. This was very much a question designed to find out if we were a) stopping people creating packages and b) making good use of our resources by looking to expand to other platforms.</p><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Summary</h2><p>So thank you again to everyone who took part in this survey, it is fantastic to get so much community engagement on the project. Not only does it help us make informed decisions but getting comments from people clearly passionate and interested in the project is fantastic. It can be easy to get caught in a echo chamber so it is really important to get input from people who may not be as present on our various social platforms but still want to have their voice heard.</p>',9),P={href:"https://github.com/pulsar-edit/.github/tree/main/surveys/20230524-ProjectFeedback",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},j=t("p",null,"I don't know when we will have a new survey or what the topic will be but you can be fairly sure there will be one!",-1);function D(V,C){const o=l("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),r("div",null,[g,h(" more "),f,b,t("p",null,[e("Honestly there isn't much more to say as there wasn't really an overarching theme for this one like there was with our "),t("a",y,[e("first survey"),a(o)]),e(" so let's just get on with it shall we?")]),w,t("p",null,[e("Our first question was asking about upgrading our icons in Pulsar.
