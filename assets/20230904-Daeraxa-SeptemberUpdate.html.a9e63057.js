In store for you this month we have some massive changes to our CI process, some good news for Windows Chocolatey users, a new option for Pulsar&#39;s title bar, some improvements to our ppm <code>unpublish</code> command and work on a brand new utility to help clean up elements of a Pulsar installation.</p><p>I realise that this probably raises more questions than it answers, so read on to find out more!</p><h2 id="upheaving-our-ci-setup" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#upheaving-our-ci-setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Upheaving our CI setup</h2><img src="'+p+'" height="200"><p>Ever since we started providing downloadable binaries shortly after the Pulsar project properly started, we have been using Cirrus CI as our continuous integration platform. This has worked very well for us for quite some time now, but unfortunately for us, they recently decided to change their free tier and our setup puts us well beyond that free tier and into some quite serious money. At this point we had a couple of choices: either we stick with Cirrus CI by using our donors&#39; money, or we move to another platform. We chose the latter option as we simply could not justify nor sustain the costs.</p>',6),y={href:"https://github.com/confused-Techie",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k={href:"https://github.com/DeeDeeG",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},v={href:"https://github.com/Meadowsys",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},x=e("p",null,"So what does this mean for our community?
