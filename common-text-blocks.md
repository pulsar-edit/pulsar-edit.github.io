# Reusable reference blocks

This section is for reusable blocks to establish standards for presentation
within our Documentation in regards to our blocks of warnings and other
common areas. These use Vuepress' slots for danger, warning, tip and details.
Use the first two as sparingly as possible unless ***ABSOLUTELY*** necessary.
