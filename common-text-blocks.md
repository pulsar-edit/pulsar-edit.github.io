# Reusable reference blocks

This section is for reusable blocks to establish standards for presentation
within our Documentation in regards to our blocks of warnings and other
common areas. These use Vuepress' slots for danger, warning, tip and details.
Use the first two as sparingly as possible unless ***ABSOLUTELY*** necessary.


## For sections that are under construction.

``` ::: warning Under Construction

The documentation here is under heavy construction. Updates are coming, and
likely in the works. If not, please report a issue in our repository for this
site. You can find on the page linked in our header.

:::
```


## For archived sections

```

::: danger STOP

This is an archive of the atom documentation. This is only here for historical
purposes. This is solely a functional reference of how things used to work.
Processes in this section may have changed in both functionality and
presentation since these were originally written. Our updated documentation can
be found at: <insert link here>
