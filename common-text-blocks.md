# Reusable reference blocks

This section is for reusable blocks to establish standards for presentation
within our Documentation in regards to our blocks of warnings and other
common areas. These use Vuepress' slots for danger, warning, tip and details.
Use the first two as sparingly as possible unless ***ABSOLUTELY*** necessary.


## For sections that are under construction.

``` ::: warning Under Construction

The documentation here is under heavy construction. Updates are coming, and
likely in the works. If not, please report a issue in our repository for this
site. You can find on the page linked in our header.

:::
```


## For archived sections

```

::: danger STOP

This is being kept for archival purposes only from the original Atom documentation. As this may no longer be relevant to Pulsar you use this at your own risk.
Current Pulsar documentation is found at [Generic Link](link/to/main/docs/section).
